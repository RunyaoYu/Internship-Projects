# Internship-Projects
It contains codes of several projects that I completed during the internship

Also, you can find my temporary grade and rank (top 15%). 
Please note that I aquired the grade 1.0 for the exam "Deep Learning" and "Variation Inference in Robotics", 
after updating this semester's transcript, my grade would go to 1.7 and therefore higher rank. 
Adding the grade of my master thesis at BMW, my final grade would be 1.4 (Dean's list)
